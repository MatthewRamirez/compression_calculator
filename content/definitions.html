<p><h3>What do all of those terms mean?  Here we go.</h3>

<hr>

<ul>
<li><p><h4>Number of cylinders</h4>
<p>This one is easy.  Just enter the number of cylinders your engine has.
</li>
<li><p><h4>Bore</h4>
<p>This is the diameter of the cylinders which are the big holes in the engine block.
</li>

<li><p><h4>Stroke</h4>
<p>This is the distance the piston will travel in the cylinder.
</li>

<li><p><h4>Rod Length</h4>
<p>The length of the connecting rod when measured from the center of the big end to the center of the small end.
</li>

<li><p><h4>Deck Height</h4>
<p>The distance from the crank center line to the top of the cylinder.
</li>

<li><p><h4>Chamber Volume</h4>
<p>This is the volume of the combustion chambers in the cylinder head.
</li>

<li><p><h4>Piston Volume</h4>
<p>This is the volume of the valve reliefs and dish of the piston.  For domed pistons use a negative number here.  For dished pistons use a positive number.
</li>

<li><p><h4>Piston Compression Height</h4>
<p>This is the distance from the centerline of the wrist pin to the top of the piston.  Do not measure from the dome or dish.
</li>

<li><p><h4>Gasket Thickness</h4>
<p>The compressed thickness of the head gasket.
</li>

<li><p><h4>Gasket Bore</h4>
<p>The diameter of the big holes in the cylinder head gasket.
</li>

<li><p><h4>Boost</h4>
<p>The amount of boost you will be running measured in PSI.
</li>

<li><p><h4>Altitude</h4>
<p>The distance above sea level that your engine will be operating in.
</li>

</ul>

Finally, I found this image through a google image search and it is a crude, but effective diagram of the more difficult to visualize terms in this list.  I&#39;m sure it will be of use to some.
