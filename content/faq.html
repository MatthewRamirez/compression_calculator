<h2>Compression Calculator FAQ</h2>
</div>
<p><h3>Here are some common questions and their answers.</h3>

<hr>

<ul>
<li><p><h4>I have the pro version.  How do I delete a saved engine?</h4>
<p>When on the engine list screen, long press on the engine name and then select delete from the context menu.
</li>
<li><p><h4>Will you be adding any new features to this app?</h4>
<p>This app is written in my limited spare time, but I might add something if I think it would be useful to have.  If you have a suggestion or even just a hate mail please send it to <a href="mailto:compression@spaghettiprogramming.com">compression@spaghettiprogramming.com</a>.
</li>
<li><p><h4>This is a lot of information to enter.  Do I really have to enter it all?</h4>
<p>If you want to have a good estimate of what the static compression ratio will be in real life you will need to.  There are other apps out there that don't ask for all of the detailed information and they are less accurate because of it.  Spending all your time and money building a motor that pings constantly because your compression ratio is too high is not fun at all.
</li>
<li><p><h4>What if these calculations are wrong?</h4>
<p>This program comes with no guarantee of accuracy and is for entertainment purposes only.  If you do not agree to this, then you should not use this application.
</li>
<li><p><h4>This is such a great app!  How can I show my gratitude?</h4>
<p>Simply rating the app or writing a short review on the Android Market would be greatly appreciated.  If you really want to make my day (and yours) you can purchase the license for the <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=spaghetti.android.CompressionLicense">pro version</a>!
</li>
</ul>
